The show almost intentionally plays into stereotypes for comedic effect only to flip a 180, and reveal that there is more going onto to someone than what is one the surface. A low-key a masterpiece and ahead of its time.</p>

                The series is beautifully shot, the cast is fantastic and each character has a slow reveal from who they are in Tony's eyes to who they really are.</p>

Obviously it was a lot better with Charlie Sheen but I don't think it was that terrible with Ashton Kutcher as some people say. It's one of those shows you can have on in the background as you're doing other stuff around the house because you've seen all the episodes several times.</p>
